🚀 Tesla Stock Price Prediction


Welcome to the Tesla Stock Price Prediction repository! This project involves the analysis and prediction of Tesla's stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically employing the XGBoost algorithm.


Project Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive approach to predicting Tesla's closing stock prices based on historical data. We utilize various data preprocessing techniques, normalization, and machine learning to forecast future stock prices with reasonable accuracy.


✨ Features

📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the stock price data to prepare it for analysis and model training.

📈 Visualization: Provided visual representations of the stock price trends.

📉 Normalization: Applied MinMaxScaler for scaling the data.

🗂️ Dataset Splitting: Divided the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

🤖 Modeling: Used XGBoost, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting algorithm, for prediction.

📏 Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


📁 Data
The dataset used in this project is a historical record of Tesla's stock prices, including the following columns:

Date: The date of the recorded stock price.

Open: The opening price of the stock.

High: The highest price of the stock during the day.

Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.

Close: The closing price of the stock.

Adj Close: The adjusted closing price of the stock.

Volume: The volume of stocks traded.


🛠️ Steps to Reproduce
1. 📥 Data Loading and Preprocessing
Read the historical stock price data.
Rename columns for consistency.
Convert the Date column to datetime format.
Visualize the closing prices over time.
2. 📊 Data Normalization
Normalize the closing prices using MinMaxScaler to scale the values between 0 and 1.
3. ✂️ Data Splitting
Split the normalized data into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.
4. 🧩 Creating Datasets
Create datasets for the model by generating sequences of stock prices for the given time_step.
5. 🧠 Model Training
Train an XGBoost regressor with 1000 estimators using the training data.
6. 📈 Model Evaluation
Predict the stock prices on the test data.
Evaluate the model's performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.


🏆 Results
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): A measure of errors between paired observations expressing the same phenomenon.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): A measure of the differences between predicted and actual values.
These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
